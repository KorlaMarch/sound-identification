# Sound Identification program
This is a sound analyzing program. It use Fast Fourier transform and K-nearest neighbors algorithm to find out, which musical instrument has produced the input sound. Currently, it answer in 3 choices, piano, guitar and violin (ablity to add more is in to-do list).
However, this program is still WIP and may not have proper UI to use it directly from node webapp.

## To-Do List

- [ ] add more UI
- [ ] improve correctness
- [ ] clean up some code
- [ ] full self-testing features
- [ ] write a batter document
